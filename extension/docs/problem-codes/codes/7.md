# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `7` with alias `unknown-token`

> Potentially fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling code

This generic error catches any expressions or code that is detected where it isn't expected. For example, catching parentheses in function definitions:

```idl
pro myPro, arg1, arg2, ()
                     ; ^^ illegal parentheses
```

This is a catch-all problem code that is used when we have an unexpected token that we do not expect to see.

Here is a list of specific unknown tokens we encounter:

- [idl(8): illegal-arrow](./8.md)
- [idl(9): illegal-comma](./9.md)
- [idl(10): illegal-colon](./10.md)
- [idl(11): illegal-include](./11.md)
- [idl(13): illegal-ternary](./13.md)
- [idl(17): illegal-struct](./17.md)
- [idl(18): illegal-paren](./18.md)
- [idl(19): illegal-bracket](./19.md)

> Pro tip: This is a catch-all for specific tokens that don;t have their own problem codes.
