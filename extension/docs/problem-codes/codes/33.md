# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `33` with alias `unclosed-main`

> Potentially fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling code

If you have a main level program without an end, you'll get this error

```idl
; main level
compile_opt idl2
a = 'foo'
if !true then begin

endif
; ^^^^ unclosed main
```

To correct, add an `end` statement:

```idl
; main level
compile_opt idl2
a = 'foo'
if !true then begin

endif
end
```

## Concept: Batch Files

This error is a helper "error" to catch common mistakes. It is not a fatal error unless you have block statements in your main level program.

If you exclude the final `end` you can use executive commands (like `.reset` and `.compile` freely), but this is an advanced use case and not common.
